- Improved spacing of main menu buttons.
- Added clearer visual separators between diary entries.
- Mobile Layout Fix: Moved deck and discard piles to their own row to prevent overlapping with the score preview.
- Mobile UX: Auto-scroll to top when typing to keep cards visible.
- Mobile UX: Hide deck/discard piles during the River phase to save screen space (Mobile only).
