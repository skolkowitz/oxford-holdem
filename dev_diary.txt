Welcome to the Developer Diary!
We've added this section to keep you updated on all the latest changes, bug fixes, gameplay tweaks, and controversial game balance breaking bonuses we're bringing to Oxford Hold 'Em (note: this is now a working title...).
(Because apparently we've somehow turned into game developers now, and this is the kind of thing they seem to do...?)
Recent changes include:
- Added this Developer Diary
- UI improvements for mobile devices.
